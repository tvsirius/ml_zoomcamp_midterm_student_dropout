# ml_zoomcamp_midterm_student_dropout
ML project for students dropout prediction

This project is based on the Dropout Analysis for School Education dataset
[Dataset info](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeevabharathis/student-dropout-analysis-for-school-education)
[Details here](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/7/11/146)

Main purpose is to predict the chance of student dropout


Project is deployed to the GCP and you can test it here:
